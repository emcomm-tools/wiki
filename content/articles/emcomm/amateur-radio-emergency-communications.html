<p>In times of crisis and <a href="Natural_disaster" title="Natural disaster">natural disasters</a>, <a href="Amateur_radio" title="Amateur radio">amateur radio</a> is often used as a means of emergency communication when <a href="Landline" title="Landline">wireline</a>, <a href="Cell_phones" class="mw-redirect" title="Cell phones">cell phones</a> and other conventional means of communications fail.
</p><p>Unlike commercial systems, amateur radio is usually independent of terrestrial facilities that can fail.  It is dispersed throughout a community without "choke points" such as cellular telephone sites that can be overloaded.
</p><p>Amateur radio operators are experienced in improvising antennas and power sources and most equipment today can be powered by an automobile battery. Annual "<a href="Field_Day_(amateur_radio)" title="Field Day (amateur radio)">Field Days</a>" are held in many countries to practice these emergency improvisational skills.  Amateur radio operators can use hundreds of frequencies and various communications modes to quickly establish networks tying disparate agencies together to enhance <a href="Interoperability" title="Interoperability">interoperability</a>.
</p><p>Recent examples include the <a href="September_11_attacks" title="September 11 attacks">September 11 attacks</a> on the <a href="World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001)" title="World Trade Center (1973–2001)">World Trade Center</a> in <a href="Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> in 2001, the <a href="2003_North_America_blackout" class="mw-redirect" title="2003 North America blackout">2003 North America blackout</a> and <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> in September 2005, where amateur radio was used to coordinate disaster relief activities when other systems failed. In 2017, the <a href="Red_Cross" class="mw-redirect" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> requested 50 amateur radio operators be dispatched to <a href="Puerto_Rico" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> to provide communications services in the wake of <a href="Hurricane_Maria" title="Hurricane Maria">Hurricane Maria</a>.<sup id="cite&#95;ref-CNN17&#95;1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CNN17-1"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

</p><p>The largest disaster response by U.S. amateur radio operators was during <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> which first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane went through Miami, Florida on August 25, 2005, eventually strengthening to Category 5. More than a thousand ham operators from all over the U.S. converged on the Gulf Coast in an effort to provide emergency communications assistance.  Subsequent Congressional hearings highlighted the Amateur Radio response as one of the few examples of what went right in the disaster relief effort.<sup id="cite&#95;ref-ARRLWeb1&#95;6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ARRLWeb1-6"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>6<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="United_States">United States</h3></div>
<p>In the <a href="United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, there are three major methods of organizing amateur radio emergency communications: the <a href="Amateur_Radio_Emergency_Service" title="Amateur Radio Emergency Service">Amateur Radio Emergency Service</a> (ARES), an organization of amateur operators sponsored by the <a href="American_Radio_Relay_League" title="American Radio Relay League">American Radio Relay League</a> (ARRL); <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://radiorelay.org/">Radio Relay International</a>, which provides radio operator certification and organizes radio networks and volunteers to respond to emergencies as outlined in a National Response Plan; and the <a href="Radio_Amateur_Civil_Emergency_Service" title="Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service">Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service</a> (RACES), a standby replacement radio service regulated by the <a href="Federal_Communications_Commission" title="Federal Communications Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a>.

Thus ARES and RACES involvement within the same area are usually intertwined, with many governments requiring membership and service in that locale's ARES organization to allow operations within the Amateur Radio Service as well.  Many government <a href="Emergency_operations_center" title="Emergency operations center">Emergency Operations Centers</a>, Red Cross Chapters and <a href="National_Weather_Service" title="National Weather Service">National Weather Service</a> facilities have permanent Amateur Radio stations installed for such operations.

</p><p>Radio clubs independent of the ARRL and ARES also participate in emergency communications activities in some areas, and some non-radio organizations have their own amateur arm.  The <a href="United_States_Department_of_Defense" title="United States Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> sponsors the <a href="Military_Auxiliary_Radio_System" title="Military Auxiliary Radio System">Military Auxiliary Radio System</a> (MARS) program which utilizes Amateur Radio operators for emergency communication using military radio frequencies.
