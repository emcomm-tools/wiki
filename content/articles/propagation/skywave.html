<p>In <a href="Radio_communication" class="mw-redirect" title="Radio communication">radio communication</a>, <b>skywave</b> or <b>skip</b> refers to the <a href="Radio_propagation" title="Radio propagation">propagation</a> of <a href="Radio_waves" class="mw-redirect" title="Radio waves">radio waves</a> <a href="Reflection_(physics)" title="Reflection (physics)">reflected</a> or <a href="Refraction" title="Refraction">refracted</a> back toward Earth from the <a href="Ionosphere" title="Ionosphere">ionosphere</a>, an <a href="Ionization" title="Ionization">electrically charged</a> layer of the upper <a href="Atmosphere_of_Earth" title="Atmosphere of Earth">atmosphere</a>.  Since it is not limited by the curvature of the Earth,  skywave propagation can be used to communicate beyond the <a href="Horizon" title="Horizon">horizon</a>, at intercontinental distances.  It is mostly used in the <a href="Shortwave" class="mw-redirect" title="Shortwave">shortwave</a> <a href="Frequency" title="Frequency">frequency</a> bands.
</p><p>As a result of skywave propagation, a signal from a distant <a href="AM_broadcasting" title="AM broadcasting">AM broadcasting</a> station, a <a href="Shortwave_radio" title="Shortwave radio">shortwave</a> station, or &#8211; during <a href="Sporadic_E_propagation" title="Sporadic E propagation">sporadic E propagation</a> conditions (principally during the summer months in both hemispheres) &#8211; a distant <a href="VHF" class="mw-redirect" title="VHF">VHF</a> <a href="TV/FM_DX" class="mw-redirect" title="TV/FM DX">FM or TV station</a> can sometimes be received as clearly as local stations.  Most long-distance shortwave (<a href="High_frequency" title="High frequency">high frequency</a>) radio communication &#8211; between 3 and 30&#160;MHz &#8211; is a result of skywave propagation. Since the early 1920s <a href="Amateur_radio" title="Amateur radio">amateur radio operators</a> (or "hams"), limited to lower transmitter power than <a href="Broadcasting" title="Broadcasting">broadcast stations</a>, have taken advantage of skywave for long-distance (or "<a href="DX_communication" class="mw-redirect" title="DX communication">DX</a>") communication.
</p><p>Skywave propagation is distinct from <a href="Line-of-sight_propagation" title="Line-of-sight propagation">line-of-sight propagation</a>, in which radio waves travel in a straight line, and from <a href="Non-line-of-sight_propagation" title="Non-line-of-sight propagation">non-line-of-sight propagation</a>.

<p>The ionosphere is a region of the upper <a href="Earth%27s_atmosphere" class="mw-redirect" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, from about 80&#160;km (50 miles) to 1000&#160;km (600 miles) in altitude, where neutral air is <a href="Ion" title="Ion">ionized</a> by solar <a href="Photon" title="Photon">photons</a>, <a href="Solar_particle_event" title="Solar particle event">solar particles</a>, and <a href="Cosmic_ray" title="Cosmic ray">cosmic rays</a>. When <a href="High-frequency" class="mw-redirect" title="High-frequency">high-frequency</a> signals enter the ionosphere at a low angle they are bent back towards the Earth by the ionized layer.<sup id="cite&#95;ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup> If the peak <a href="Ionization" title="Ionization">ionization</a> is strong enough for the chosen frequency, a wave will exit the bottom of the layer earthwards – as if obliquely <a href="Reflection_(physics)" title="Reflection (physics)">reflected</a> from a mirror. Earth's surface (ground or water) then <a href="Diffuse_reflection" title="Diffuse reflection">reflects</a> the descending wave back up again towards the ionosphere.
</p><p>When operating at frequencies just below the <a href="Maximum_usable_frequency" title="Maximum usable frequency">maximum usable frequency</a>, losses can be quite small, so the radio signal may effectively "bounce" or "skip" between the Earth and ionosphere two or more times (multi-hop propagation), even following the curvature of the Earth.  Consequently, even signals of only a few Watts can sometimes be received many thousands of miles away. This is what enables <a href="Shortwave" class="mw-redirect" title="Shortwave">shortwave</a> broadcasts to travel all over the world. If the ionization is not great enough, the wave only curves slightly downwards, and subsequently upwards as the ionization peak is passed so that it exits the top of the layer only slightly displaced. The wave is then lost in space. To prevent this, a lower frequency must be chosen. With a single "hop", path distances up to 3500&#160;km (2200 miles) may be reached. Longer transmissions can occur with two or more hops.<sup id="cite&#95;ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>2<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Near-vertical_skywaves">Near-vertical skywaves</h3></div>
<p>Skywaves directed almost vertically are referred to as <a href="Near_vertical_incidence_skywave" title="Near vertical incidence skywave"><i>near-vertical-incidence skywaves</i> (<i>NVIS</i>)</a>. At some frequencies, generally in the lower <a href="Shortwave" class="mw-redirect" title="Shortwave">shortwave</a> region, the high angle skywaves will be reflected directly back towards the ground. When the wave returns to ground it is spread out over a wide area, allowing communications within several hundred miles of the transmitting antenna. NVIS enables local plus regional communications, even from low-lying valleys, to a large area, for example, an entire state or small country. Coverage of a similar area via a line-of-sight VHF transmitter would require a very high mountaintop location. NVIS is thus useful for statewide networks, such as those needed for emergency communications.<sup id="cite&#95;ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>3<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup> In short wave broadcasting, NVIS is very useful for regional broadcasts that are targeted to an area that extends out from the transmitter location to a few hundred miles, such as would be the case in a country or language group to be reached from within the borders of that country. This will be much more economical than using multiple FM (VHF) or AM broadcast transmitters. Suitable antennas are designed to produce a strong lobe at high angles. When short range skywave is undesirable, as when an AM broadcaster wishes to avoid interference between the ground wave and sky wave, <a href="Anti-fading_antennas" class="mw-redirect" title="Anti-fading antennas">anti-fading antennas</a> are used to suppress the waves being propagated at the higher angles.

For example, to best reach a receiver 500 miles away during the night using the <a href="F_region" title="F region">F layer</a>, an antenna should be chosen that has a strong lobe at 40 degrees elevation. For the longest distances a lobe at low angles (below 10 degrees) is best. For NVIS, angles above 45 degrees are optimum.  Suitable antennas for long distance would be a high Yagi or a rhombic; for NVIS, a dipole or array of dipoles about .2 wavelengths above ground; and for intermediate distances, a dipole or Yagi at about .5 wavelengths above ground. Vertical patterns for each type of antenna are used to select the proper antenna.
</p><div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Fading">Fading</h3></div>
<p>At any distance sky waves will fade. The layer of ionospheric <a href="Plasma_(physics)" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a> with sufficient ionization (the reflective surface) is not fixed, but undulates like the surface of the ocean.  Varying reflection efficiency from this changing surface can cause the reflected signal strength to change, causing "<i><a href="Fading" title="Fading">fading</a></i>" in shortwave broadcasts.  Even more serious <a href="Selective_fading" class="mw-redirect" title="Selective fading">fading</a> can occur when signals arrive via two or more paths, for example when both single-hop and double-hop waves interfere with other, or when a skywave signal and a ground-wave signal arrive at about the same strength. This is the most common source of fading with nighttime AM broadcast signals.
Fading is always present with sky wave signals, and except for digital signals such as <a href="Digital_Radio_Mondiale" title="Digital Radio Mondiale">Digital Radio Mondiale</a> seriously limit the fidelity of shortwave broadcasts.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Other_considerations">Other considerations</h2></div>
<p><a href="Very_high_frequency" title="Very high frequency">VHF</a> signals with frequencies above about 30&#160;MHz usually penetrate the ionosphere and are not returned to the Earth's surface. <a href="E-skip" class="mw-redirect" title="E-skip">E-skip</a> is a notable exception, where VHF signals including FM broadcast and VHF TV signals are frequently reflected to the Earth during late spring and early summer. E-skip rarely affects <a href="UHF" class="mw-redirect" title="UHF">UHF</a> frequencies, except for very rare occurrences below 500&#160;MHz.
</p><p><a href="Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequencies</a> below approximately 10&#160;MHz (wavelengths longer than 30 meters), including broadcasts in the <a href="Mediumwave" class="mw-redirect" title="Mediumwave">mediumwave</a> and <a href="Shortwave" class="mw-redirect" title="Shortwave">shortwave</a> bands (and to some extent <a href="Longwave" title="Longwave">longwave</a>), propagate most efficiently by skywave at night. Frequencies above 10&#160;MHz (wavelengths shorter than 30 meters) typically propagate most efficiently during the day. Frequencies lower than 3&#160;kHz have a wavelength longer than the distance between the Earth and the ionosphere. The <a href="Maximum_usable_frequency" title="Maximum usable frequency">maximum usable frequency</a> for skywave propagation is strongly influenced by <a href="Sunspot" title="Sunspot">sunspot</a> number.
</p><p>Skywave propagation is usually degraded &#8211; sometimes seriously &#8211; during <a href="Geomagnetic_storm" title="Geomagnetic storm">geomagnetic storms</a>. Skywave propagation on the sunlit side of the Earth can be entirely disrupted during <a href="Sudden_Ionospheric_Disturbance" class="mw-redirect" title="Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance">sudden ionospheric disturbances</a>.
</p><p>Because the lower-altitude layers (the <a href="E-layer" class="mw-redirect" title="E-layer">E-layer</a> in particular) of the <a href="Ionosphere" title="Ionosphere">ionosphere</a> largely disappear at night, the refractive layer of the ionosphere is much higher above the surface of the Earth at night. This leads to an increase in the "skip" or "hop" distance of the skywave at night.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="History_of_discovery">History of discovery</h2></div>
<p><a href="Amateur_radio" title="Amateur radio">Amateur radio operators</a> are credited with the discovery of skywave propagation on the shortwave bands. Early long-distance services used <a href="Ground_wave" title="Ground wave">ground wave</a> propagation at <a href="Very_low_frequency" title="Very low frequency">very low frequencies</a>,<sup id="cite&#95;ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>4<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup> which are attenuated along the path. Longer distances and higher frequencies using this method meant more signal attenuation. This, and the difficulties of generating and detecting higher frequencies, made discovery of shortwave propagation difficult for commercial services.
</p><p>Radio amateurs conducted the first successful transatlantic tests using waves shorter than those used by commercial services<sup id="cite&#95;ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>5<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup> in December 1921, operating in the 200 meter <a href="Mediumwave" class="mw-redirect" title="Mediumwave">mediumwave</a> band (1500&#160;kHz)&#8212;the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs. In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe at 200 meters and at least 30 North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe. The first two-way communications between North American and Hawaiian amateurs began in 1922 at 200 meters.
</p><p>Extreme <a href="Interference_(wave_propagation)" class="mw-redirect" title="Interference (wave propagation)">interference</a> at the upper edge of the 150-200 meter band&#8212;the official wavelengths allocated to <a href="Amateur_radio_operators" class="mw-redirect" title="Amateur radio operators">amateurs</a> by the Second National Radio Conference<sup id="cite&#95;ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>6<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup> in 1923&#8212;forced amateurs to shift to shorter and shorter wavelengths; however, amateurs were limited by regulation to wavelengths longer than 150 meters (2&#160;MHz). A few fortunate amateurs who obtained special permission for experimental communications below 150 meters completed hundreds of long-distance two-way contacts on 100 meters (3&#160;MHz) in 1923 including the first transatlantic two-way contacts<sup id="cite&#95;ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>7<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup> in November 1923, on 110 meters (2.72&#160;MHz)
</p><p>By 1924 many additional specially licensed amateurs were routinely making transoceanic contacts at distances of 6000 miles (~9600&#160;km) and more. On 21 September several amateurs in California completed two way contacts with an amateur in New Zealand. On 19 October amateurs in New Zealand and England completed a 90-minute two-way contact nearly halfway around the world. On October 10, the Third National Radio Conference made three shortwave bands available to U.S. amateurs<sup id="cite&#95;ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>8<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup> at <a href="80-meter_band" title="80-meter band">80 meters</a> (3.75&#160;MHz), <a href="40-meter_band" title="40-meter band">40 meters</a> (7&#160;MHz) and <a href="20-meter_band" title="20-meter band">20 meters</a> (14&#160;MHz). These were allocated worldwide, while the <a href="10-meter_band" title="10-meter band">10-meter band</a> (28&#160;MHz) was created by the Washington International Radiotelegraph Conference<sup id="cite&#95;ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>9<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup> on 25 November 1927.

</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Marconi">Marconi</h3></div>
<p><a href="Guglielmo_Marconi" title="Guglielmo Marconi">Guglielmo Marconi</a> was the first to show that radios could communicate beyond line-of-sight, using the reflective properties of the ionosphere. On December 12, 1901, he sent a message around 2,200 miles (3,500&#160;km) from his transmission station in <a href="Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, England, to <a href="St._John%27s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="St. John&#39;s, Newfoundland and Labrador">St. John's</a>, <a href="Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="Newfoundland and Labrador">Newfoundland</a> (now part of <a href="Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>). However, Marconi believed the radio waves were following the curvature of the Earth – the reflective properties of the ionosphere that enables 'sky waves' were not yet understood. Skepticism from the scientific community and his wired telegraph competitors drove Marconi to continue experimenting with wireless transmissions and associated business ventures over the next few decades.<sup id="cite&#95;ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>10<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>
</p><p>In June and July 1923, <a href="Guglielmo_Marconi" title="Guglielmo Marconi">Guglielmo Marconi</a>'s land-to-ship transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from <a href="Poldhu" title="Poldhu">Poldhu Wireless Station</a>, <a href="Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, to his yacht Ellette in the <a href="Cape_Verde" title="Cape Verde">Cape Verde Islands</a> off the west coast of Africa. In September 1924, Marconi transmitted during daytime and nighttime on 32 meters from Poldhu to his yacht in <a href="Beirut" title="Beirut">Beirut</a>. Marconi, in July 1924, entered into contracts with the British <a href="General_Post_Office" title="General Post Office">General Post Office</a> (GPO) to install high speed shortwave telegraphy circuits from London to Australia, India, South Africa and Canada as the main element of the <a href="Imperial_Wireless_Chain" title="Imperial Wireless Chain">Imperial Wireless Chain</a>. The UK-to-Canada shortwave "Beam Wireless Service" went into commercial operation on 25 October 1926. Beam Wireless Services from the UK to Australia, South Africa and India went into service in 1927.
</p><p>Far more spectrum is available for long-distance communication in the shortwave bands than in the long wave bands; and shortwave transmitters, receivers and antennas were orders of magnitude less expensive than the multi-hundred kilowatt transmitters and monstrous antennas needed for long wave.
</p><p>Shortwave communications began to grow rapidly in the 1920s,<sup id="cite&#95;ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>11<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup> similar to the internet in the late 20th century. By 1928, more than half of long-distance communications had moved from transoceanic cables and long-wave wireless services to shortwave "skip" transmission, and the overall volume of transoceanic shortwave communications had vastly increased. Shortwave also ended the need for multimillion-dollar investments in new transoceanic telegraph cables and massive long-wave wireless stations, although some existing transoceanic telegraph cables and commercial long-wave communications stations remained in use until the 1960s.
</p><p>The cable companies began to lose large sums of money in 1927, and a serious financial crisis threatened the viability of cable companies that were vital to strategic British interests. The British government convened the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference<sup id="cite&#95;ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>12<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup> in 1928 "to examine the situation that had arisen as a result of the competition of Beam Wireless with the Cable Services". It recommended and received Government approval for all overseas cable and wireless resources of the Empire to be merged into one system controlled by a newly formed company in 1929, Imperial and International Communications Ltd. The name of the company was changed to <a href="Cable_%26_Wireless_plc" title="Cable &amp; Wireless plc">Cable and Wireless Ltd.</a> in 1934.
